    <h2>Green Engineer | Data Analyst | Sustainability Strategist</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Tejal, a passionate sustainability advocate with a background in engineering and data science.
      My goal is to use analytical tools and strategy to solve real-world environmental challenges. I specialize
      in LCA, SDG mapping, green technologies, and data-driven sustainability reporting. I’m building this
      portfolio to showcase my journey, self-initiated projects, and end-to-end work on sustainable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy turning ideas into action through creative problem-solving, data analysis, and storytelling. This space
      reflects both my technical skills and my vision for a greener future. Let’s connect!
